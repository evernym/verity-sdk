# Getting Started with the Verity SDK

## What is the Verity SDK?

The goal of the Verity SDK is easy application integration with the Verity server. This integration allows for SSI-enabled workflows like creating connections, issuing credentials, requesting proof, and other general pairwise interactions. The SDK uses libindy and DID comm protocols to securely authenticate and communicate with the Verity server. The creation of language specific SDKs allow developers to quickly integrate their backend services into the world of SSI with minimal overhead.
